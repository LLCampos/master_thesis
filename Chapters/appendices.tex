\chapter{Uploading RadLex ontology to NOBLE}
\label{app:change_radlex_noble}

I had to edit the RadLex ontology .owl file before it could be correctly processed and uploaded to NOBLE Coder. In the original .owl file the properties  "Preferred\_name" and "Synonym" are considered to be \textit{DatatypeProperty} but I had to change both to \textit{AnnotationProperty}. That is, where in the file was

\begin{lstlisting}[language=xml]
<owl:DatatypeProperty rdf:ID="Preferred_name">
</owl:DatatypeProperty>
\end{lstlisting}

I've had to change it to:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=xml]
<owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:ID="Preferred_name">
</owl:AnnotationProperty>
\end{lstlisting}

And the analogous thing for the "Synonym" property.
