\section{Motivation}
\label{motivation}

Radiology reports describe the results of radiography procedures (e.g., X-ray imaging) and have the potential of being an useful source of information, which can bring benefits to health care systems around the world. But because these reports are written in a free-text mode, it is hard to extract information automatically from them. This is more problematic when these reports were mostly stored in physical format (paper) - the fact that these reports can now be accessed digitally make them amenable for processing using Text Mining techniques. 

A lot of work has been done on this research area \citep{Pons2016}, but it is usually assumed that the reports are written in English. For example, \citep{Hassanpour2016} created an information extraction system for English reports that depends on RadLex, a lexicon for radiography terminology, which is freely available in English. Because of this, the system can not be applied to reports written in other languages. And even if the system was not dependable on an English lexicon, it is not certain if the results would be the same if text in another language was used.

Assuming that the information automatically extracted from radiology reports using Text Mining techniques can bring benefits to health care systems, this waste of information caused by language barriers can potentially have a negative impact on everyone's health.

Translation of the reports is one obvious potential solution to the problem. If the translation is done by professionals trained in the translation of medical texts, we probably can assume that not much information is lost in translation. We call this type of translation Human Translation (HT). But professional translators are expensive and there are a lot of reports to translate, so this would have a really high monetary cost. Another option is to use Machine Translation (MT). Notwithstanding the lower translation quality, it is way cheaper and more feasible in a large scale. Finally, an option that tries to get the best of both worlds is using Machine Translation with Post-Editing (MT-PE) by humans. Basically, the text is automatically translated by a machine and then the translation is corrected by a human. Cheaper than the HT option and with better quality than the MT one. 

But how much information is modified or lost during MT or MT-PE compared to HT, affecting the results of Text Mining tools? This is still an open question. 

\section{Objectives}

For the best of my knowledge this thesis is the first attempt to study how translation affects the application of Text Mining techniques in medical text. In this thesis I have studied how MT and MT+PE compares with HT on the simple task of Named-entity recognition (NER) using a dictionary-based approach, this dictionary consisting of RadLex terms. The identification of RadLex terms can be useful, for example, in image retrieval \citep{Gerstmair2012} systems, so this is not just a toy example. 

If I have non-English radiology reports and I want to translate them so that I can identify RadLex terms for use on some other system, what kind of translation should I use? In this thesis, I try to help to answer this question. 

\newcommand{\hypothesis}{
\begin{description}
	\item[Hypothesis:] MT-PE is a good trade-off between quality and cost, compared with MT and HT, for translating radiology reports for the purpose of identifying RadLex terms. 
\end{description}
}
\hypothesis

For this to be true, these conditions have to hold:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item MT-PE has to be cheaper than HT
	\item MT-PE quality for the task at hand has to be close to HT quality
	\item MT-PE quality for the task at hand has to be better than MT quality, enough to compensate its higher cost
\end{enumerate}

The last condition its important because if MT-PE quality is similar to MT quality, as MT cost is lower, maybe it's worth to just use MT. In this thesis I only try to answer to the quality issues, not doing a thorough economic analysis of the problem. 

\section{Methodology}

%To answer this questions I've created a parallel corpus containing a number of scientific articles related to radiology and corresponding HT, MT and MT+PE translations. This reports were annotated with RadLex terms
