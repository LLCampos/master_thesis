\section{Motivation}
\label{motivation}

Radiology reports describe the results of radiography procedures and have the potential of being an useful source of information, which can bring benefits to health care systems around the world. However, these reports are usually written in free-text and thus it is hard to automatically extract information from them. Nonetheless, the fact that most reports are now digitally available make them amenable for using Text Mining tools. Another advantage of Radiology reports is that even if written in free-text, they are usually well structured.

A lot of work has been done on Text Mining of Biomedical texts, including health records \citep{Pons2016}, but although Radiology reports are usually written in the native language of the radiologist, Text Mining tools are mostly developed for English. For example, \citep{Hassanpour2016} created an information extraction system for English reports that depends on RadLex, a lexicon for radiography terminology, which is freely available in English. Given this dependence, the system cannot be easily applied to reports written in other languages. And even if the system was not dependable on an English lexicon, it is not certain that the results would be the same if text in another language was used, because of, for example, differences in syntax. This creates an obstacle to the sharing of Radiology information between countries, which is important to understand and effectively address health problems.

There are mainly two possible solutions to this problem. One is to translate the lexicon itself \citep{Bretschneider} and the other is to translate the reports. Translating the lexicon has the advantage of not requiring continuous translation, i.e., after translating a lexicon to, for example, Spanish, we can then use it to process as many untranslated Spanish reports as needed. However, when a new version of the lexicon is released the changes need also to be translated, otherwise the translated lexicon would become outdated. In this work I explore the alternative option of translating the reports and check its feasibility. This approach has the advantage that the translated reports would be accessible to any doctor who understands English and the state-of-the-art Text Mining tools focused on English text can be applied without any need for adaptation. 

If the translation is done by professionals trained in the translation of medical texts, we probably can assume that not much information is lost in translation. We call this type of translation Human Translation (HT). But expert translators are expensive and there are a lot of reports to translate, so this would have a really high monetary cost. Another option is to use Machine Translation (MT). Notwithstanding the lower translation quality, it is way cheaper and more feasible in a large scale. Finally, an option that tries to get the best of both worlds is using Machine Translation with Post-Editing (MT-PE) by humans. In this approach the text is automatically translated by a machine and then the translation is corrected by a human. Cheaper than the HT option and with better quality than the MT one. 

Thus in this work I aimed at addressing the following question: what kind of translation should be used to translate non-English Radiology reports to English to then apply Text Mining tools? From the best of my knowledge, currently there is no publicly available study that provided a quantitative evidence to answer this question. This could be explained by the lack of a parallel corpus that could be used to study this.

To the best of my knowledge, the most similar work to this one is \citep{Castilla2007a}. He founds that a rule-based MT system has a good performance in translating Portuguese text to English for the purposes of applying a text mining tool (better described in \ref{multilingual-text-mining}). The author doesn't compare translation systems, something that is done on the present work.

\section{Objectives}

In this thesis I have studied how MT and MT+PE compares with HT on the simple task of Named-entity recognition (NER) using a lexicon-based approach, this lexicon consisting of RadLex terms. The identification of RadLex terms can be useful, for example, in image retrieval \citep{Gerstmair2012} systems, so this is not just a toy example. 

If I have non-English radiology reports and I want to translate them so that I can identify RadLex terms for use on some other system, what kind of translation should I use? In this thesis, I try to help to answer this question. 

\newcommand{\hypothesis}{
\begin{description}
	\item[Hypothesis:] MT+PE is a good trade-off between quality and cost, compared with MT and HT, for translating radiology reports for the purpose of identifying RadLex terms. 
\end{description}
}
\hypothesis

For this to be true, these conditions have to hold:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item MT+PE has to be cheaper than HT
	\item MT+PE quality for the task at hand has to be close enough to HT quality
	\item MT+PE quality for the task at hand has to be better than MT quality, enough to compensate its higher cost
\end{enumerate}

The last condition its important because if MT+PE quality is similar to MT quality, as MT cost is lower, maybe it's worth to just use MT. In this thesis I only try to answer to the quality issues, not doing a thorough economic analysis of the problem. 

\section{Methodology}

To answer these questions I've compared the results of the NER task on the MT and MT+PE translations with the results of the NER task on the HT translation. Assuming that the HT translation is the right translation, the closer the results are to the ones of the HT, the better the translation for the task at hand. So, for the proposed hypothesis to be true, the results of the NER task on the MT+PE task have to be closer to the results of the HT translation than the results of the MT translations.

For this purposes I've created a parallel corpus containing a number of scientific articles related to radiology and corresponding HT, MT and MT+PE translations. These reports were annotated with RadLex terms using the Open Biomedical Annotator and NOBLE Coder. The annotations of the MT and MT+PE translations were then compared with the ones from HT.
